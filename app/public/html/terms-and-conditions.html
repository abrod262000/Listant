                jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the

                OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note
                that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator
                are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
